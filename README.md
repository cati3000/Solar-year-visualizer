# Solar Year Visualizer

A MATLAB application that visualizes solar data and calculations throughout the year. This tool provides an interactive interface to explore geospatial solar information with animation capabilities.

## Overview

Solar Year Visualizer is designed to help you understand and visualize solar patterns and calculations across different time periods. The application combines geospatial data processing with dynamic animations to create an intuitive interface for solar analysis.

## Getting Started

Run the main.m file in MATLAB to launch the application. The interface will open with default solar parameters that you can adjust to explore different scenarios and visualizations.

## Features

The application includes comprehensive sun position calculations, allowing you to compute solar angles and positions with precision. You can visualize this data through animated displays that show how solar parameters change throughout the year. The interactive interface lets you modify settings in real-time and instantly see the results.

## Components

The project consists of several MATLAB modules working together. The main interface handles user interactions and controls, while background calculations compute solar positions and geospatial information. Animation functions bring the data to life with smooth, dynamic visualizations.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in the documentation.pdf file for comprehensive information about the solar calculations and usage guide.

## Requirements

MATLAB with plotting and UI capabilities for running this application.
